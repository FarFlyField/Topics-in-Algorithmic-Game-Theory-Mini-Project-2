 Recall Gale andShapleyâ€™s DAalgorithmfromclass. In this project, you will implement this algorithm.
 You will numerically verify some of the results we have seen, and you will investigate the outcomes that
 occur when the preference orderings of the agents are drawn from various probability distributions.

 To see some results and graphs, run:
 python question_s_1_2.py
 python question_s_3.py
  python question_s_4.py


 python question_e_1_2.py
 python question_e_3.py
  python question_e_4.py
